내 의견
Actually, I am the one of the Korean have a long-padded coat. I have bought it 2 years age, to keep my body warm. When I bought the coat, its coat around 300,000 won (But I had bought this my money, not my parents). And that time most of long-padded coats are expensive. Because only few brands made the clothes, before it became a trends.
But now long-padded coats are trends, so many company has sold the clothes in price cutting race. Result of this situation we can get many options that have good quality with reasonable price under 50,000 ~ 100,000 won. And more people who need a warm coat for cold winter can buy one. Trends should not always be a target of criticism.
